###This article gives a introduction to git as a VCS. It explains the concept of repositories, branches and remote, how to create it, how to commit changes, how to use log, how to add files, remove files, and rename files, how to see the status, how to merge, and  all the basic command and concept of git. This article is really useful for git beginners.
